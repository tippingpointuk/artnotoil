&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;'30 November 2024:&lt;/strong&gt; A banner unfurls from high above the Great Court. It reads DROP BP. Fluttering briefly between two ionic columns, it settles. Heads turn to look up. Then a flashmob appears from nowhere. To the tune of Space Odyssey singers launch into TIME TO DROP BP. The flagship British Museum has chosen to accept huge amounts of funding from BP for its redevelopment programme. BP is a global oil company that continues to prioritise massive investment in fossil fuels, in fact has doubled down on this type of investment in recent years. The museum purports to be sustainable. It is not sustainable to collaborate and promote one of the fossil fuel giants who are wrecking biodiversity and lives across the planet. What is a museum if not a place to learn, discover, and treat different cultures with respect? Oil magnates profiting out of climate emergency with no thought for populations devastated by it are NOT SUSTAINABLE.'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;time datetime="2024-07-13T13:56:29+00:00"&gt;From our friends at &lt;a href="https://cultureunstained.org/2024/07/13/science-museum-drops-equinor-sponsorship-as-it-fails-to-align-with-1-5c-paris-target/"&gt;Culture Unstained&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/time&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;time datetime="2024-07-13T13:56:29+00:00"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cultureunstained.org/2024/07/13/science-museum-drops-equinor-sponsorship-as-it-fails-to-align-with-1-5c-paris-target/" rel="bookmark" title="Permalink to Science Museum drops Equinor sponsorship as it fails to align with 1.5°C Paris target"&gt;July 13, 2024&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Science Museum forced to drop Equinor as sponsor after it failed to meet museum’s criteria that its business must align with Paris Agreement 1.5°C target&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Museum accused of cynically attempting to avoid embarrassment for Norwegian oil and gas firm by burying “seismic shift” under news of UK General Election&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Pressure grows on museum to now end sponsorship ties to major polluter BP and Indian coal mining and arms conglomerate Adani&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a huge win for the campaign against fossil fuel sponsorship, the Science Museum has confirmed that its controversial sponsorship deal with the Norwegian oil and gas producer Equinor is over following years of opposition from campaigners and scientists, who are calling the move a ‘seismic shift’. Equinor had sponsored the museum’s ‘Wonderlab’ gallery for children since 2016 in a bid to boost its brand in the UK but the partnership will not be renewed after Equinor failed to meet the museum’s new climate criteria: to align its business with the Paris Climate Agreement goal of limiting global warming to 1.5°C. The museum is now facing calls to cut sponsorship ties to major polluter BP and the Indian coal mining conglomerate Adani. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sarah Waldron, Co-director of Culture Unstained, which has campaigns against fossil fuel sponsorship of culture, has said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘This is a seismic shift. After years of mounting pressure, the Science Museum has now adopted red lines on climate change which have led to Equinor being dropped. Yet rather than proudly telling the world that it took action because its sponsor was flouting climate targets backed by governments around the world, the museum continues to push the false narrative that its polluting sponsors are leading the energy transition. With BP also failing to align its business with Paris Agreement goals and Adani the world’s biggest private producer of coal, the museum must now hold these companies to the same standard and stop promoting their toxic brands.’  &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Activists scatter 40,000 snowflakes inside the Science Museum’s ‘Energy Hall’ in protest at Equinor’s (then Statoil) sponsorship of the Wonderlab gallery for children. Photos: Kristian Buus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The news was quietly &lt;a href="https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/galleries-that-inspire/"&gt;announced in a blogpost&lt;/a&gt; by the Science Museum’s Chair Sir Tim Laurence just days before the UK General Election in an apparent attempt to dodge scrutiny of Equinor’s exit. Despite stating in his post that &lt;em&gt;‘those we partner with must demonstrate that they are moving with sufficient urgency along the transition pathway to meet our aspirations’&lt;/em&gt;, he does not make clear that it is Equinor’s failure to meet criteria in the museum’s Sustainability Policy that triggered the end of the partnership. However, emails disclosed to campaign organisation Culture Unstained following a Freedom of Information (FOI) request show that Equinor had been contacted by the Director in 2022, and again in November 2023, about the future of the relationship after the Transition Pathway Initiative (TPI) had &lt;a href="https://www.transitionpathwayinitiative.org/companies/equinor"&gt;concluded that Equinor’s business&lt;/a&gt; was not aligned with the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement, the threshold set by the museum for its corporate sponsors (see below). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Laurence instead claims that the sponsorship had merely &lt;em&gt;‘drawn to a close at the end of their current contract term’&lt;/em&gt; and thanks Equinor, while misleadingly referring to it as a ‘broad energy company’ despite its core business remaining in oil and gas extraction. The Science Museum was heavily criticised in the past for including a non-disparagement or “gagging clause” in &lt;a href="https://cultureunstained.org/smgcomplaint/"&gt;its original contract with Equinor&lt;/a&gt;, first revealed following an FOI request by Culture Unstained in 2018, which prevented staff from making comments that could be seen as ‘discrediting or damaging the goodwill or reputation of the Sponsor’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Activists protest outside the Science Museum as it hosted a ‘Meet the Funder’ event for staff with Equinor inside.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lauren MacDonald, Lead Campaigner at Stop Rosebank, commented:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The Science Museum of all places should not have taken this long to accept that Equinor – a fossil fuel giant – does not align with the Paris Agreement. However, the much overdue move could turn the tide against the trend of fossil fuel sponsorship and greenwash which has become all too common in our cultural institutions. The museum should be wearing the red lines it has adopted with pride, not hiding behind corporate lies that polluting energy sponsors can address the climate crisis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Equinor is the majority owner of the Rosebank oil field, which is currently being challenged in the Scottish courts. If Rosebank goes ahead, the field will produce more CO2 than the world’s 28 lowest-income countries combined in one year. It is an excellent example of why Equinor is not serious about its energy transition. As institutions like the Science Museum turn their back on the likes of Equinor, we urge others to follow suit and mount pressure on the company to pull the plug on the Rosebank project.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Equinor’s sponsorship was widely promoted on posters and adverts across the London Underground and rail network.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equinor’s exit represents a significant blow to the standing of Director Ian Blatchford and his stubborn defence of the museum’s fossil fuel sponsorships, previously &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/9aa5197c-b46c-11e9-bec9-fdcab53d6959"&gt;telling the Financial Times&lt;/a&gt; that, ‘&lt;em&gt;Even if the Science Museum were lavishly publicly funded, I would still want to have sponsorship from the oil companies.’&lt;/em&gt; The museum now faces questions over why it is continuing to partner with BP when, last year, the Church of England dropped its remaining fossil fuel investments &lt;a href="https://www.churchofengland.org/media/press-releases/church-commissioners-england-exclude-oil-and-gas-companies-over-failure-align"&gt;after concluding that&lt;/a&gt; no major oil and gas company – including BP – is &lt;em&gt;‘aligned with the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement, as assessed by the Transition Pathway Initiative (TPI).’ &lt;/em&gt;Adani, the controversial sponsor of the museum’s new ‘Energy Revolution’ gallery, is the world’s biggest private producer of coal and partners with Israeli arms firm Elbit on the production of drones being used in the genocide in Palestine.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julie Forchhammer, co-founder Klimakultur, a Norwegian non-profit working with the arts and culture sector on taking climate action, has said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I visited the Science Museum in London last year and saw first-hand how Equinor was marketed to the kids experiencing the Wonderlab Gallery, so it’s great news to hear that Equinor is now out of the museum. It gives me hope that the same can happen here in Norway where Equinor sponsors Teknisk Museum in Oslo and the science centres in Bergen, Gjøvik, Nordland, Sandnes, Sarpsborg, Stavanger, and Trondheim. We urgently need more awareness of how it impacts a small country like Norway to have hundreds of thousands of children and their families targeted by Equinor each year, through the science centres, in school classes and at universities. These campaigns in the UK show how we can approach this issue in Norway, where the fossil fuel disinformation machinery is ingrained so deeply in all aspects of society.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Activists from Art Not Oil and Natur og Ungdom protest outside the Science Museum as guests arrive for the opening of Wonderlab: the Statoil Gallery in 2016.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Photos: Kristian Buus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Wonderlab: the Statoil Gallery’ opened &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2016/oct/17/with-entry-charges-and-oil-sponsorship-the-science-museum-has-lost-its-way"&gt;amidst significant opposition&lt;/a&gt; in 2016 with Norwegian youth activists joining a creative protest at the opening of the gallery, and scientists, campaigners and then Green Party MP Caroline Lucas &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/10/science-museum-should-drop-statoil-sponsorship-of-childrens-gallery"&gt;signing a letter&lt;/a&gt;urging the museum to drop what was then Statoil as a sponsor. Despite changing its name to Equinor as part of an attempt to “greenwash” its image, Equinor continued to face opposition as it invested heavily in new oil and gas extraction including in the Arctic and, more recently, over its plans to expand into the Rosebank oil field in the North Sea. The museum has also faced numerous protests, interventions and open letters from scientists, youth activists and Indigenous leaders over its fossil fuel partnerships, with the announcement of a sponsorship deal with Adani in 2021 prompting the resignation of Dr Hannah Fry and Dr Jo Foster as trustees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

									&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

									&lt;p&gt;I made this poster as part of a Brandalism campaign, featuring 8 other artists, which has taken over 200 billboards, bus stops and London Underground tube carriages, to highlight Shell's PR and advertising strategies, which attempt to create warm brand associations amongst climate-conscious youth audiences whilst at the same time accelerating fossil fuel production.&lt;/p&gt;

									&lt;p&gt;Shell is advertising to kids, cosying up to politicians, paying influencers and co-opting the emotional connections we have with sports to launder their public image.&lt;br /&gt;
									&lt;br /&gt;
									But behind its billion-dollar marketing efforts the company is back pedalling on its own green pledges, profiting from our soaring energy bills and facing legal challenges across the globe for violating human rights.&lt;/p&gt;

									&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

									&lt;p&gt;The Hell Bus will also be coming out of hibernation soon and back on the road (see below for details!). Unfortunately for me that also means its insurance is up for renewal soon which cost £4000 last year!

&lt;h3&gt;Thursday 21 March 2024, 8.30pm&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;​Science Museum’s secret VIP opening of new climate gallery hit by protest over coal and arms sponsor Adani&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Protesters greeted guests at every entrance to the Science Museum as it hosted private opening of new climate gallery&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;‘Energy Revolution’ gallery mired in controversy since announcement in 2021 over choice of coal and arms-producing conglomerate Adani as sponsor&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fossilfreesciencemuseum.com/reclaim-the-science-museum" target="_self"&gt;More protest planned for Saturday 23rd March&lt;/a&gt; at 2pm as activists vow to ‘Reclaim the Science Museum’ from fossil fuel sponsors BP, Equinor and Adani&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As smartly dressed guests arrived at the Science Museum in London this evening (Thursday 21 March) for the VIP opening of its new climate change gallery, they were greeted by protest over its choice of controversial coal mining and arms-producing conglomerate Adani as the gallery sponsor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the museum having made no announcement about the public opening of the ‘Energy Revolution’ gallery next week, hundreds of invited guests arrived for the private opening, greeted by drumming, banners, and flyers denouncing the sponsor. The museum has faced growing opposition since the sponsorship was announced and, just weeks ago, was &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk6SKObAALE" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;confronted by climate activist Greta Thunberg&lt;/a&gt; and members of Extinction Rebellion when they directly challenged the museum’s Science Director Roger Highfield during a panel event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guests to the private opening included gallery contributors, corporate guests and Science Museum trustee Baroness Nicky Morgan. Protesters chanted, drummed and spoke to guests, despite attempts by security to prevent them exposing Adani’s climate and human rights record. The group unfurled large banners across the entrance reading ‘Adani Out’, ‘Shameful Sponsorship’, ‘End toxic fossil fuel sponsorship’ and ‘BP, Equinor and Adani are killing our planet’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rhian Ashford, who is part of the Fossil Free Science Museum coalition and took part in the protest, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This Adani sponsorship deal is completely indefensible. For the Science Museum to claim that ‘Adani Green Energy’ is in no way connected to the Adani Group’s coal mines and power stations, alleged corruption and human rights abuses is a complete joke and simply not backed up by the facts. Right now, Adani’s coal projects are being resisted on the ground by Indigenous communities in India and Australia, while it also partners with Israeli weapons firm Elbit Systems, profiting from the suffering of Palestinians. No museum or public institution should be helping such a toxic firm to boost its brand and cynically promote its green credentials by sponsoring a climate change gallery.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the new ‘Energy Revolution’ gallery having been sold to Adani as “attracting a global audience of millions”, the museum has remained tight-lipped about the opening plans in what appears to be a concerted attempt to sidestep further opposition and protest: no public announcement of its opening date has been made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ‘Fossil Free Science Museum’ coalition has also &lt;a href="https://www.fossilfreesciencemuseum.com/reclaim-the-science-museum" target="_self"&gt;announced a family-friendly protest&lt;/a&gt; this Saturday afternoon at 2pm to ‘Reclaim the Science Museum’ from its fossil fuel sponsors BP, the Norwegian state oil firm Equinor, and Adani.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Science Museum defends its controversial sponsorship deal by claiming that it is only taking money from Adani’s renewables subsidiary, Adani Green Energy. However, &lt;a href="https://cultureunstained.org/adani-deal-timeline/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;internal emails&lt;/a&gt; disclosed under FOI rules show that the museum has primarily corresponded with the main Adani Group and brushed off clear evidence that Adani Green Energy was &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/india/adani-group-firms-pledge-shares-lenders-flagship-company-sbicap-trustee-2023-02-11/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;used to help generate funds&lt;/a&gt; for Adani’s Carmichael coal mine in Australia which is being resisted by Traditional owners of the land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investigations by research organisation Culture Unstained have revealed how the Science Museum had identified instances of corruption, fraud and human rights impacts as part of an internal 12-page due diligence report into the Adani Group but the museum then &lt;a href="https://cultureunstained.org/adani-deal-timeline/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;moved ahead with a sponsorship deal&lt;/a&gt; with Adani Green Energy in an apparent bid to sidestep the clear ethical conflicts. Adani has long been resisted by Indigenous Adivasi communities in India as it constructs new coal-fired power stations and coal mines on their lands. The conglomerate has also been accused of profiting from the ongoing genocide of Palestinians in Gaza via its partnership with Israeli arms firm Elbit Systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://hindenburgresearch.com/adani/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;report by the Hindenburg Group&lt;/a&gt; last year alleged that the Adani group had committed fraud and stock manipulation on a “historic scale”, concerns &lt;a href="https://cultureunstained.org/adanicomplaint/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;brushed off in an email&lt;/a&gt; from the Director of the Science Museum to Adani as merely a week that must have been “rather torrid”. Just this week, Bloomberg also reported that Adani &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-15/us-prosecutors-widen-investigation-into-adani-group-focus-on-potential-bribery" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;may now be investigated&lt;/a&gt; for bribery by the US Department of Justice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2016, &lt;a href="https://cultureunstained.org/successes-for-the-movement/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;16 major UK cultural institutions&lt;/a&gt; including the National Portrait Gallery, Tate and Royal Shakespeare Company have ended sponsorship deals with major polluters such as BP and Shell. Leading science organisations, such as Amsterdam’s NEMO science museum, Kew Gardens and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/03/edinburgh-science-festival-charity-bans-fossil-fuel-sponsorship" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Edinburgh Science Festival&lt;/a&gt; have also cut their ties to fossil fuel producers, with the latter commenting in 2019 that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Whilst we see change happening in the oil and gas sector and appreciate that the demands on them are complex, we are of the view that the sector is not moving fast enough to meet the IPCC targets and that there is a conflict between their behaviour and the underlying science.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

  <title>New Adani/Science Museum spoof film</title>
  <link>https://www.artnotoil.org.uk/blog/new-adaniscience-museum-spoof-film</link>
  <description>&lt;span class="field field-name-title field-formatter-string field-type-string field-label-hidden"&gt;New Adani/Science Museum spoof film&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="field field-name-uid field-formatter-author field-type-entity-reference field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;span lang="" about="https://www.artnotoil.org.uk/users/art-not-oil" typeof="schema:Person" property="schema:name" datatype="" xml:lang=""&gt;Art Not Oil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="field field-name-created field-formatter-timestamp field-type-created field-label-hidden"&gt;Thu, 07/12/2023 - 9:00am&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;div class="clearfix text-formatted field field-node--body field-formatter-text-default field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden has-single"&gt;&lt;div class="field__items"&gt;&lt;div class="field__item"&gt;&lt;blockquote type="cite"&gt;An update from the ever-industrious and inspired Culture Unstained:&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote type="cite"&gt;Today (5.12.23), &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/science-museum-chief-sir-ian-blatchford-adani-sponsorship-deal-8ql5n5nqv" target="_blank"&gt;The Times&lt;/a&gt; has broken the story of our latest investigation - which &lt;b&gt;reveals how the Director of the Science Museum in London pushed through the decision to take sponsorship money from the coal-producing conglomerate Adani&lt;/b&gt;…for a new climate gallery!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But how does a leading science museum end up signing sponsorship deals with major fossil fuel producers?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Check out&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/Cult_Unstained/status/1731991577558421885" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;b&gt;this new “spoof” film&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - based directly on our investigation and FOI releases - where the Director of the Science Museum reveals all the steps you need to take in order to help greenwash a fossil fuel giant like Adani! &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Please watch and give it a share &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/Cult_Unstained/status/1731991577558421885" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;b&gt;on Twitter/X&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt; and &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/C0eNmjRIcEq/?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;b&gt;on Instagram&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Our full investigation also reveals how:&lt;br /&gt;
 
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The Science Museum held evidence showing that its sponsor ‘Adani Green Energy’ was directly tied to the conglomerate’s coal projects - but repeatedly dismissed the concerns&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;In an email to Adani, the Director brushed off the damning Hindenburg Group report accusing Adani of ‘the biggest con in corporate history’ as just a few weeks that ‘must have been rather torrid’&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;But the Director’s now been formally sidelined from future decisions scrutinising sponsors!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So, we’ve now &lt;a href="https://cultureunstained.org/adanicomplaint/" target="_blank"&gt;submitted a 34-page formal complaint&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt; to the museum’s Board of Trustees&lt;/b&gt; ahead of their meeting this week, calling on them to investigate how the Director pushed through such an indefensible deal. It sets out how sector-wide ethics rules may have been breached and why the deal should be dropped.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You can &lt;a href="https://cultureunstained.org/2023/12/05/ethics-complaint-made-against-science-museum-director-over-adani-sponsorship/" target="_blank"&gt;get the &lt;b&gt;full story&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;- with links to the film and our findings - on our website! And we’re also asking people to take action by writing to the museum’s Board of Trustees &lt;a href="https://actionnetwork.org/letters/tell-the-science-museum-to-drop-fossil-fuel-sponsors/" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks for your support'&lt;/blockquote&gt;
